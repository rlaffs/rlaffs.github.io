            <br>I live in Cazenovia, NY, just a short drive from Syracuse. I was actually born at St. Joseph's Hospital in Syracuse. This picture is of me at Chittenango Falls, which is only a few minutes from my house. </br>
            <br>My major is Applied Data Analytics in the School of Information at Syracuse University. I also have a minor in History, and I am considering adding a minor in Political Science. </br>
            <br>I love watching sports, especially Chelsea in the Premier League(I haven't really enjoyed watching them recently though), the Bills, and Syracuse football/basketball, which I have watched all of my life. </br>
